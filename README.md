# codeshare
A repository for sharing test codes
Please look at the version history of the Makefile
version 1 is the Makefile to generate assembly code during building the binary. Use this version if your target is to generate assembly code along with the object files
version 2 shows how to link shared library information to the binary so that during runtime it can locate the shared library (.so) if the shared library is in some non-standard location (other that /usr/lib)
